        Why 6Metre Financial? '<a href="">Why Not?</a>' The inspiration for the firm name
        stems from the 6 Metre class of racing sailboats.  'Why Not?' was
        built in Sweden in 1947 and competed in the 1948 Olympics.  After
        a well-traveled history, including tenure in New York, the vessel
        is now owned and captained within the family.

        The 6 Metre class is known for its agility, performance, and
        adaptability to conditions.  The vision for this firm, founded upon
        similar principles, was to create a highly sophisticated, client
        centered financial services firm that leverages industry leading
        technology to deliver comprehensive financial strategies.
