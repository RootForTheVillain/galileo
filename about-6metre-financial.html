  <h3>How We Engage</h3>
  <p>
    Financial needs vary drastically from client to client.  We will work with
    you to determine the proper scope of engagement.  This could be anything
    from single product solutions (e.g. you just want a 20 year term life
    insurance policy and nothing more)
    <a href="#360-degree-planning" class="router-link">to comprehensive financial planning</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>We Firmly Believe in Open Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    Let's face it—it would be difficult for one company to be the best at
    everything in the financial services industry.  The reality is that there
    are a lot of great products out there.  We want to bring the added value of
    access to a broad universe of insurance and investment products—regardless
    of company.

  <h3>The Art</h3>
  <h4>Take the time</h4>
  <p>
    Having spent my entire working career in financial services, I've learned
    a lot about customer service, relatability, and helping people understand
    and navigate a very complex industry.  I've found that strategic financial
    decisions are often very emotional decisions for people to make.
    Clients want to understand the strategic benefit of a proposed solution
    and be 100% comfortable with their decision so that they are not left
    with the feeling of buyer's remorse.  Taking the time to thoroughly
    explain concepts, openly discuss pros and cons, be transparent with product
    costs/fees, and answer questions are the key elements that build trust to
    create longstanding advisory relationships.
  </p>
  <h4>Do what you say you are going to do</h4>
  <p>
    Financial advisors are hired and fired based upon service.  Clients
    want—and deserve—a financial professional that they can meet with
    consistently, returns calls promptly, and is accessible.
  </p>
  <h4>Stay the course</h4>
  <p>
    Let's face it—the markets will go up and the markets will go down.
    Investors, as a group, tend to diminish (or destroy) portfolio returns
    by acting on their emotions during difficult market cycles.  Having a
    dedicated financial coach, who can help you deal with volatility and
    remind you of your long term financial goals can go a long way in helping
    you maintain perspective.
  </p>
  <h3>The Science</h3>
  <h4>Purpose</h4>
  <p>
    Every financial instrument in your portfolio should have a specific
    purpose.  Knowing how to apply appropriate product solutions that align
    with client goals and create optimal efficiency is essential.
  </p>
  <h4>Analytics</h4>
  <p>
    I've been blessed/cursed with the type of mindset that always wants to
    understand exactly how something works.  Aside from driving my wife crazy,
    this has served me quite well in my professional life.  If I'm at the point
    where I am showing you a specific product solution, I can assure you that
    it will have been thoroughly vetted and dissected!
  </p>
  <h4>Specialization</h4>
  <p>
    The focal point of my practice is rooted in retirement income planning.
    People are taught throughout their career to save, save, save.  When day
    one of retirement begins, how do you know how much you can spend so that
    you don't run out of money?
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many articles and studies that address the idea of the 'safe
    withdrawal rate' in retirement.  I have dedicated an enormous amount of
    time, attention, and research to this issue and have developed strategies
    to help clients achieve a successful retirement.

    Riley (Lab/Pitbull mix).  When he is not working and “off duty” as a parent,
    you can find him slicing the golf ball on the course, attempting to be a
    DIY expert around the house, chasing the hockey puck up and down the ice rink,
    pretending he’s in a rock band on the drum set, and/or enjoying a glass of
    fermented grape juice (preferably a dry red wine)!
